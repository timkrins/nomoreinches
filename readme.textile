h1. nomoreinches.
    
nomoreinches takes output recieved from *pcb2gcode*, parses it, and outputs a file ready for sending to a *grbl* cnc controller.
The output will be in millimetres (A measurement system used in some "lesser" countries of the world...)
AND the minimum X and Y coordinates will be re-zeroed - something which can be extremely useful :)

Also, if you have a better name for this program, send me an email!

timkrins at the google dot the com

to compile, run
_gcc mm.c -o nomoreinches_

and to use the application, run

_nomoreinches [input gcode file]_

Otherwise, use the python version.

_python nomore.py [input gcode file]_

It will look for the default "front.ngc" unless you specify another.

It will generate a new file called _convert-to-mm.ngc_

Load this new file into your favorite serial command sender, and away you go :)
